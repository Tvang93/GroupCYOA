Our CYOA story:

Player is recruited to fight a Swamp Hag. They are offered to train for the fight under one of 3 tutors: a Knight, a Priest, or a Mage.
Once player has learned under their mentor, they traverse the swamp and encounter the Hag. The fight begins, and two different choices show up depending on who mentored them.
Knight choices (Sword, Spear) Sword: The blade is too short and does not reach the Hag before you get turned into a toad [fail].  Spear: Your spear reaches the Hag before she finishes chanting her spell [win].
Priest choices (Intervention, Holy Song) Intervention: You beseech your godâ€™s help, raining down radiant destruction upon the Hag [win]. Holy Song: Hag calls your song annoying and attempts to curse you. The sounds of both chants overlap as good and evil clash, causing an explosion, killing hag and leaving you badly wounded but alive [barely win].
Mage choices (Cast Fireball, Cast Control Water) Cast Fireball: player casts Fireball, but they get caught up in the blast radius too because the room is too small [fail]. Cast Control Water: Player controls the swamp water to envelop the Hag. She manipulates plants to be thrown at you, but you just barely hang on long enough to drown her [barely win].
