                As the Hag chants her spell you start singing the hymns you practiced to banish the evil creature. However, the Hag finishes first and throws a mass of purple energy at you. The moment it touches you your body is wracked with pain, as though every fiber in your being is wailling in agony. But even as you're moments away from passing out from the pain, you sing the last words of the song, and a gentle light emerges from you. It shoots out towards the Hag before she can react and her figure quickly fades away from sight. With the fight finished, you collapse on the ground, unconscious.
