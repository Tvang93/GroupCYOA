                You decided to train in the ways of the Holy Priests. Your days are spent practicing prayers and hymns, learning to heal wounds and dispel curses. After weeks of training, you finally feel prepared to face off against the Hag and set out for her swamp. Trekking through the muddy waters, you eventually locate her wooden shack on a stretch of land surrounded by gnarled trees. You barge through the door to find the grotesque dining on a deer's carcass. She looks at you with an annoyed expression and begins to chant a spell. What do you do?
