                You have chosen the way of the spear. You train with the knight to improve on your spear mastery. You
                learn to draw out the full strength of the spear, utilizing its most advantagous feature: its length. The spear is now an extension of your own body. You train your spear night and day, awaiting you final confrontation with the Hag.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is finally time for your battle with the hag. You and your mentor find the Hag in a swamp. You ready
                your spear, confident in all your training thus far. You notice the hage raising her finger and begin
                chanting some incantations. You charge desperately at the hag and thrusting for her head. Your thrust aims true and pierces through her neck preventing her from finishing the spell.
