                As the Hag begins chanting you put your hands together and pray to your deity for help. You hear as the Hag finishes her incantation and lobs an orb of purple energy at you. You cover yourself with your hands, bracing for the impact, but it doesn't come. A veil of white light separates you and the Hag. Then suddenly, you feel a rumble as the outside seems to shine brightly through the windows. It gets brighter and brighter, when the roof above the hag bursts open as radiant light descends upon her. She screams out in agony for only a moment before quickly fading away.
