                You have chosen the way of the sword. You train with the knight to improve on your swordsmanship. You
                learn to draw out the versatility of the sword, making it not only a deadly weapon but also a capable
                shield. You learn to utilize its combat flexibility being able to deal heavy slashing or piercing damage
                depending on which is better for the situation. You train vigorously day and night to prepare for your
                battle with the wicked Hag.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is finally time for your battle with the hag. You and your mentor find the Hag in a swamp. You ready
                your blade, confident in all your training thus far. You notice the hage raising her finger and begin
                chanting some incantations. You charge desperately at the hag and swing for her head. Your swing falls
                short and the Hag casts Polymorph on you turning you into a toad.
