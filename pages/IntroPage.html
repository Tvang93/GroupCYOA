                You, a lone adventurer, arrive in a town weary from your travels. The world is fraught with dangers and the journey has been rough, so you look for a tavern inn to settle in for the next few days. You saunter into the nearest tavern you could find, take a seat, and place your order. As you eat your food you hear the doors to the establishment swing open, and four individuals walk towards you. One of them speaks up, referring to themselves as a messenger of the local dukedom, and that they're conscripting you for a mission of utmost importance.
